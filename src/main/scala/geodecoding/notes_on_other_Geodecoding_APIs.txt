According to the number of coordinates given
by GTFS, and the requirement of free of API-keys
services, there are other GeoDecoders available,
like ESRI ArcGIS Rest services API (token-less):

  https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/geocode/api-reference/geocoding-reverse-geocode.htm

Their implementation is very similar to the
one present here, since they may be able to
return JSON answers. All depends on the number
of coordinates given by GTFS, which is what
drives these requests.
