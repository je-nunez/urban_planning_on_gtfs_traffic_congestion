# Urban Planning using Traffic Congestion from different data sources

Urban Planning using Urban Traffic Congestion from different data sources, like the
`General Transit Feed Specification` (GTFS), etc.

This work has been partly inspired by research done by Robert Cervero Ph.D., Freisen
Chair of Urban Studies and Professor of City and Regional Planning at the University
of California, Berkeley, and others, on `Transit-Oriented Urban Development`. Their
coverage is quite ample and profound, among other things, on the 5 different
`Dimensions` of Transit, `Density`, `Diversity`, `Design`, `Destination Access`, and
`Distance to Transit`.

This specific work is **NOT** supported or related, either directly or indirectly, by
the above authors, who should not be contacted for this work.

This inspiration is to unite this work on Urban Development with routinary, detailed
data on Traffic Congestion like can be obtained from minute, daily `General Transit Feed
Specification` data sets, etc., which give very detailed information on some aspects on
Urban Transit, although **NOT** all the aspects these researchers analyze and encourage,
which are sometimes not available yet in the routinary, daily, quite exact format that
`GTFS` data-sets offer.
